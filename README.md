## Topic: Traffic Signal Recognition and Detection (TSRD)

*Traffic Signal Recognition and Detection (TSRD) is a crucial technology in the field of autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). It involves two main tasks: detecting traffic signals in a natural environment (the road) and classifying them.* 

The primary objective of TSRD is to improve road safety by providing real-time information to drivers or autonomous vehicles about the traffic signals encountered along the road. These signals can include speed limits, stop signs, warnings, and other regulatory signals. To achieve these objectives, various artificial intelligence approaches, such as computer vision, have been employed over the years, yielding concrete results in performing the proposed tasks. 

In this regard, our work has focused on studying the issues related to the application of machine learning to the main tasks of recognition and detection, and on developing artificial intelligence models capable of addressing the identified issues. Finally, we implemented the proposed networks to carry out the complete TSRD activity. The developed networks were trained and tested using the GTSRB(GermanTrafficSignalRecognition) and GTSDB (German Traffic Signal Detection) datasets.
